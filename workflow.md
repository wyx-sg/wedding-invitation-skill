# Workflow — how to drive the conversation

This file teaches the agent (you) how to take a user from "I want to make a wedding invitation" to a finished PNG. The flow has **7 stages** (Stages 1-6 plus Stage 2.5 mode selection). Do not skip stages. Do not start writing HTML before Stage 4.

## Speak the user's language

The moment language is set in Stage 2, **switch your conversational language to match `languages[0]` (the primary language)**. This means every subsequent question, summary, status update, AskUserQuestion label, error message, and follow-up to the user — all in the primary language. Examples:

- `["zh"]` → reply only in Chinese (中文回复). Don't slip into English even for "Render now?" or "Done!".
- `["zh", "en"]` → reply primarily in Chinese (primary), but English technical terms / template ids are fine inline.
- `["en"]` → reply in English.
- `["ja"]`, `["es"]`, `["ko"]`, ... → reply in that language; if you can't, reply in English and apologize.

Code, file paths, template ids, JSON keys, and bash commands stay in their native form. Only your **prose to the user** changes language. This is non-negotiable — a Chinese-language invitation built with an English-speaking agent feels disconnected; the conversational language IS part of the design experience.

## The two modes

After collecting wedding data (Stage 2) but before the aesthetic stage, the user picks a mode:

- **Single mode (default)** — design 1 custom template, iterate 3-5 rounds, export PNG. Best when the user knows roughly what they want.
- **Multi mode** — generate N variants in parallel (3 / 5 / 8, or user-specified), present in a gallery, user picks favorite. Either download as-is, or "iterate on this one" → drops back into single-mode flow with the chosen variant as the starting point.

The end of both modes is a local `dist/index.html` gallery page with download buttons for two PNG sizes (social 1080×1440 + print 2160×2880).

## How to interact with the user — 3-tier degradation

For every choice you ask the user to make, prefer the richest interaction the current environment supports:

```
Tier 1 (preferred):  HTML preview in the user's browser
                     Use when: choice is visual (style direction, photo crop, layout)
                     Method: write _preview.html with side-by-side options;
                             tell the user to refresh; ask which one in text
                             or via AskUserQuestion.

Tier 2 (fallback):   AskUserQuestion tool (in-agent multiple-choice modal)
                     Use when: choice is non-visual but discrete (yes/no, short list)
                     Note:    AskUserQuestion is Claude Code specific. In other
                              agents (Cursor / Aider / Codex / Gemini), fall back
                              to Tier 3.

Tier 3 (last resort): plain text question in chat
                     Use when: above unavailable, or answer is open-ended
                     (e.g. "Groom's name in Chinese?")
```

Examples:

| Choice | Best tier |
|---|---|
| Pick an aesthetic direction | Tier 1 — render reference thumbnails side-by-side |
| Pick which photo is primary | Tier 1 — show all photos as cards |
| Square vs round photo frame | Tier 1 — render both, side-by-side |
| Date / time / venue / names | Tier 3 — open text |
| "Render now?" / "Use red or gold accent?" | Tier 2 — AskUserQuestion |
| Choose invitation language(s) | Tier 2 (or Tier 3 if AskUserQuestion unavailable) |

Never start with Tier 3 if the choice is visual. A wedding invitation is a visual artifact; words alone cannot usefully describe "oval vs square vs arched photo frame".

## Stage 1 — Set up the workspace

1. **Choose working directory.** Default `~/my-wedding/`. Ask:
   > "Where should I put the project? (default: `~/my-wedding/`)"

2. **Copy skeleton** (use cross-platform commands appropriate to the user's OS):
   - macOS / Linux:
     ```bash
     cp -R <skill-path>/skeleton/. <working-dir>/
     cd <working-dir>/
     cp data/wedding.example.json data/wedding.json
     cp data/designs.example.json data/designs.json
     ```
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     Copy-Item -Recurse <skill-path>\skeleton\* <working-dir>\
     cd <working-dir>
     Copy-Item data\wedding.example.json data\wedding.json
     Copy-Item data\designs.example.json data\designs.json
     ```

3. **Photos** — ask:
   > "Where are your wedding photos on this machine? Give me an absolute directory path (e.g. `~/Pictures/wedding/`). I'll copy and rename them into the project."

   Copy + rename with the appropriate OS commands. HEIC handling:
   - macOS: `sips -s format jpeg <input>.heic --out <output>.jpg`
   - Linux: `heif-convert <input>.heic <output>.jpg`
   - Windows: ask the user to convert HEIC manually, or skip those files

   Confirm photo count back to the user. Don't proceed until `photos/` has at least one image.

4. **If 5+ photos** — discuss selection **before** moving on. The invitation features one primary photo (sometimes one extra). If the user dropped a whole album in, you must NOT silently pick one. Instead:

   - Read all the photos with the Read tool (they're images — Claude can see them).
   - Surface what you see: "I see N photos. Some are portrait pose, some are outdoor candid, some are full-length. Which 1-3 would you like to use on the invitation?"
   - Build a Tier-1 visual preview (`_photo-select.html`) with all photos as numbered cards so the user can answer "p03, p07, p12" rather than describing them in words.
   - Wait for an explicit selection. Note their primary choice — that goes into `designs.json` as `primary_photo`. Keep the rest copied in `photos/` so the gallery's photo-switcher can offer them.

   Skip this step if the user gave you ≤4 photos — assume they've already curated.

## Stage 2 — Language and couple details

This is the **first** content decision. Don't assume Chinese (or any language).

1. **Ask language(s)** via AskUserQuestion (Tier 2) or plain text (Tier 3):
   > "What language(s) should the invitation be in?"
   > - English only
   > - Chinese only (中文)
   > - Bilingual: Chinese + English
   > - Other (specify, e.g. Spanish, Japanese, Korean)

2. **Write the `languages` field** into `data/wedding.json` as an array of language codes:
   - English only → `["en"]`
   - Chinese only → `["zh"]`
   - Bilingual zh+en → `["zh", "en"]` (primary first)
   - Other → use ISO 639-1 codes: `["es"]`, `["ja"]`, `["ko"]`, `["fr"]`, etc.

3. **Pick font CDN** (Tier 2 or 3). This is a one-line question that determines which Google Fonts mirror the rendered HTML loads from:
   > "Where will you preview this invitation from?"
   > - mainland China (use `fonts.font.im` — the CN mirror)
   > - elsewhere (use `fonts.googleapis.com` — official, faster)

   Write the answer into `data/wedding.json` as `font_cdn`: `"fontim"` for CN, `"googleapis"` for everywhere else. Default to `"googleapis"` if the user isn't sure.

4. **Gather the seed fields** — ask one at a time, in the language(s) chosen:

   | Field | Question | When required |
   |---|---|---|
   | `names.groom_zh` / `bride_zh` | "Groom's / bride's Chinese name?" | if `zh` in languages |
   | `names.groom_en` / `bride_en` | "Groom's / bride's English name (FAMILY GIVEN, all caps preferred)?" | if `en` in languages |
   | `names.groom_<lang>` / `bride_<lang>` | "Names in <language>?" | for other languages |
   | `date.iso` | "Wedding date? (YYYY-MM-DD)" | always |
   | `time.value` | "Ceremony start time? (HH:MM, 24-hour)" | always |
   | `venue.city_<lang>`, `venue.lines_<lang>` (array) | "Venue: city + 2-line address in each language" | per language |
   | `venue.name_<lang>` | "Venue name (e.g. hotel / church)?" | per language |
   | `date.lunar` | "Include a lunar date on the invitation? (e.g. 戊辰年八月十五)" | **only if `zh` in languages** — see rule below |

   **Lunar date rule** — the lunar date question is **Chinese-context only and skip-by-default**:
   - If `zh` is NOT in `languages` → do not ask about lunar at all. Skip the row entirely.
   - If `zh` IS in `languages` → ask only as an optional add-on, framed as opt-in not opt-out: "要不要在请帖上加一行农历日期？（可跳过 / 不知道就跳过）". Default to empty/skip if the user is unsure or doesn't answer immediately. Most modern Chinese couples don't include it; only ask once, accept a "no" / "skip" fast.

   **Privacy nudge** — for address detail, AskUserQuestion:
   - Full address (street level)
   - City + venue name only
   - Region / province only

4. **Run derive**:
   ```bash
   npm run derive
   ```

   `derive.js` is language-aware: it derives Chinese date formats (`zh_formal`, `weekday_zh`, etc.) only if `zh` is in `languages`, and English formats (`en_long`, `roman_year`, etc.) only if `en` is in. For other languages, it passes through whatever you wrote — you fill localized strings manually.

   Verify the printed summary matches what the user expects.

   If derive fails, the seed is incomplete or malformed for the declared languages — fix the seed and re-run.

## Stage 2.5 — Pick a mode

Right after Stage 2 (language + couple details collected), ask the user which mode they prefer.

**Use AskUserQuestion (Tier 2)** with these options:

> "How would you like to design this?"
> - **One design, iterated to perfection** — I'll design one template tailored to you and refine with your feedback. ~30 minutes, 3-5 rounds.
> - **Compare a few alternatives** — I'll generate 3 different aesthetics side-by-side. You pick the favorite (or iterate on one).
> - **See many alternatives** — I'll generate 8 different aesthetics for broad comparison.
> - **A specific number** — tell me how many (2-10).

If the user picks single: proceed to Stage 3 normally (pick one aesthetic).
If multi: proceed to Stage 3 but pick N aesthetic directions, then in Stage 4 generate all N variants.

Write the mode + count into `data/wedding.json`:
```json
{
  "mode": "single" | "multi",
  "multi_count": 1 | 3 | 5 | 8 | <user-specified>
}
```

The downstream scripts (`build-gallery.js`) inspect `designs.json.length` to determine output structure — `length == 1` → single-mode gallery (no wrap), `length > 1` → multi-mode gallery (grid + detail pages).

## Stage 3 — Aesthetic direction (Tier 1 visual preview)

This is the most important interaction. **Do not ask "do you want minimal or vintage?" in plain text** — show, don't tell.

1. **Read the user's photos** (use the Read tool — they're images). **The photos drive the recommendation.** Note:
   - **Subject framing**: head-and-shoulders portrait? half-body? full-length? group? — this changes which photo-frame shapes are viable. Tight portraits work in oval / circle / arch. Full-length needs taller rectangular or no-frame layouts. A tight crop pushed into a circle WILL clip a forehead or chin.
   - **Pose & formality**: studio formal portrait, casual outdoor candid, editorial fashion shot, traditional dress?
   - **Outfits & culture**: white gown, qipao, hanbok, sari, kimono, suit, casual?
   - **Color palette of the photo**: warm sunlight, cool studio, cream / beige, navy / black, vibrant?
   - **Composition**: where are heads/faces positioned (top third? center? off-center)?

   **Recommend aesthetics whose decorative elements + frame shape genuinely fit the photo.** Anti-patterns to avoid:
   - Don't propose `art-deco` (heavy symmetric geometric frames) for a wide casual outdoor full-length shot — the photo can't carry the frame.
   - Don't propose `red-gold` / `gugong` for a beachside / casual portrait — cultural / formal mismatch.
   - Don't propose tight circle / oval frames if the photo's subject is full-length or off-center — heads will get clipped.

2. **Pick aesthetic directions** from `design-principles.md` that fit the photos + any user hints. The number depends on mode:
   - **Single mode**: pick **3-4 candidates** → user picks one → you design that one. **Cap at 4** so the follow-up pick fits in a single AskUserQuestion modal (the tool only allows 4 options).
   - **Multi mode**: pick exactly `multi_count` candidates (no overlap), each will become a separate design

   If you really want to surface 5-6 candidates for comparison, you must commit to Tier 3 (open text) for the follow-up pick — tell the user explicitly: "type the name you like (e.g. `morandi`)" — because AskUserQuestion cannot show more than 4 options.

   Aesthetic names you can choose from, grouped by cultural origin:
   - **Chinese**: `new-chinese`, `red-gold`, `gugong`, `ink-flower`
   - **Japanese**: `wabi-sabi`
   - **Korean**: `korean-hanbok`
   - **South Asian**: `indian`
   - **Middle Eastern**: `arabic`
   - **Latin / Mexican**: `latin`
   - **European**: `french-provence`, `art-deco`, `vogue`, `newspaper`, `letter`
   - **Soft contemporary** (culturally neutral): `morandi`, `modern-minimal`, `mediterranean`, `black-gold`
   - **Themed**: `retro-poster`, `vintage-stars`

   Examples of pairing:
   - Indoor formal portraits, traditional dress → `new-chinese`, `red-gold`, `gugong`, `indian`, `korean-hanbok`
   - Outdoor casual / nature → `morandi`, `wabi-sabi`, `mediterranean`, `french-provence`
   - Editorial / fashion-y → `vogue`, `art-deco`, `modern-minimal`
   - Ornate / ceremonial → `indian`, `arabic`, `red-gold`, `gugong`
   - Festive / colorful → `latin`, `red-gold`

3. **Build a mood-board preview** — one card per candidate, showing the aesthetic's **design vocabulary** (palette swatches + a typography sample + a brief spirit / motif description). **Do NOT show pre-rendered example invitations** in this picker. Reasons:
   - The examples have other couples' names, dates, and venues — users see those, fixate on "I want THAT one", and the agent gets pulled toward literal copy.
   - Examples are in their native cultural language; if the user picked a different language, the examples don't match what they'll get.
   - Aesthetics here are **directions**, not finished templates. The picker should communicate direction, not destination.

   Build `_style-preview.html` in the user's working directory. Each card shows: aesthetic name, palette swatches (the suggested starting-point colors from `design-principles.md`), a small typography sample (a few characters in the aesthetic's font family), and one line of spirit / motif description.

   Localize the headline + note + spirit lines to the user's primary language before writing the file.

   ```

4. Tell the user:
   > "I've prepared some aesthetic directions for you to compare. Open this file in your browser: `file://<absolute-path>/_style-preview.html`"

5. After the user picks (AskUserQuestion or open text):
   - **Single mode**: user picks 1 aesthetic name → move to Stage 4 to design that one
   - **Multi mode**: user can either confirm all `multi_count` candidates or trim/swap a few. Move to Stage 4 to design all of them.

**You are designing, not picking.** The user picked a direction (`morandi`, `art-deco`, etc.). In Stage 4 you will design a fresh template in their language, with their actual data, adapting the palette/typography to their photo and preferences — using `design-principles.md` as your vocabulary, not as a fixed recipe.

## Stage 4 — Design from scratch

This is the creative stage. In single mode you design 1 template; in multi mode you design N (one per chosen aesthetic).

1. **Open `design-principles.md`**. For each chosen aesthetic, internalize:
   - **Spirit** — the soul of the aesthetic. This is the load-bearing constraint.
   - **Starting palette** — a reference, NOT a prescription. Shift hues to harmonize with the user's photo tones (cooler photo → shift accents cooler; warmer photo → shift toward warm tones).
   - **Typography family** — match the language(s); pick the specific font within the family based on the formality the couple wants.
   - **Decoration vocabulary** — pick a few motifs from the suggested list (not all), or invent ones in the same spirit.
   - **NEVER list** — these are hard. Don't violate them.
   - **Hard cultural requirements** (where listed) — non-negotiable. Skip them and you've lost the aesthetic.

   You're not stamping out a fixed template. You're designing in a direction — your job is to make judgment calls within the spirit + NEVERs of the chosen aesthetic.

2. **Do NOT read `examples/*.html`.** They are frozen Chinese showcase artifacts. Reading them biases you toward copying and toward Chinese typography. Design fresh from prose.

3. **Write each template from scratch** as `templates/<design-id>.html`:
   - Use placeholders matching the fields actually present in `data/wedding.json` (e.g. `{{names.groom_en}}` if `en` in languages, `{{names.groom_es}}` if `es` etc.)
   - Apply hard constraints from `design-principles.md` (canvas size, photo wrap, mobile-first, **no element extending outside the 420×height canvas**)
   - Set `overflow: hidden` on `.card` as a safety net so any accidentally-oversized child (giant date numerals, vertical text, SVG rays, position:absolute with negative offsets) gets clipped instead of bleeding past the canvas edge into the surrounding page background.
   - Bring in user-specific requests ("add a small icon of our dog", "make the date the most prominent element") that no aesthetic prescribes
   - In **multi mode**: each variant must look meaningfully different from the others. Don't write 3 templates that all turn into "minimalist serif + photo + name". Push range.

4. **Update `data/designs.json`** — one entry per design, with an optional `meta` block used by the gallery page:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "morandi-v1",
       "name_zh": "莫兰迪柔和",
       "name_en": "MORANDI",
       "template": "morandi-v1.html",
       "primary_photo": "photo-01",
       "width": 420,
       "height": 560,
       "meta": {
         "short": "soft contemporary · muted palette",
         "long": "Optional longer description shown in the gallery / detail page.",
         "palette": ["#e8e4dc", "#7a8a6d", "#a59585", "#2c2c2c"],
         "fonts": ["Inter", "Cormorant Garamond"],
         "motifs": "oval photo · hairline dividers"
       }
     }
   ]
   ```

   In single mode the array has length 1. In multi mode it has length N. All other downstream behavior is automatic from the array length.

## Stage 5 — Build, preview, iterate

```bash
npm run build
```

This renders every design in `data/designs.json` into `dist/<id>.html` (the raw invitation HTML, used as iframe source by the gallery).

**Single mode**: open `dist/<your-design-id>.html` in the user's browser (macOS: `open`; Linux: `xdg-open`; Windows: `start`).

**Multi mode**: skip live preview — go straight to Stage 6. The user will see all variants in the gallery at once.

**Mandatory photo-crop review.** Before showing the result to the user, **open the rendered HTML yourself** (Read the PNG output from `npm run render`, or open `dist/<id>.html` in a way you can verify) and check:

- No head, forehead, chin, or face is cropped by `.photo-wrap` border-radius / shape.
- Both people in a couple shot are visible — no one is half-cut by the frame edge.
- Important elements (hands holding rings, bouquet, etc.) are inside the frame.

If the crop is wrong, fix it BEFORE handing back to the user. Don't ship a card with a cropped forehead and let the user discover it. Common fixes:

- Adjust `object-position: center 12%` — lower the percentage (4%, 8%) to keep heads in frame, or raise (20%, 30%) for a face-centered crop.
- Switch the frame shape: circle → oval (taller) → arch (rounded top, square bottom) → rectangle. Each one clips less of the subject's head.
- Widen the photo-wrap: 240px → 280px → 320px so the photo isn't squeezed.
- If the photo is full-length and the frame is small + tight, switch to a layout that gives the photo more vertical room, or pick a different photo.

Feedback patterns (single mode iteration) and what they map to:

| User says | You change |
|---|---|
| "Font too small" | bump `font-size` 2-4 px on the relevant rule |
| "Color too dark" | lighten the hex / drop opacity |
| "Head is cropped" | `object-position: center 12%` → `8%` or `4%` |
| "Make the frame square instead of oval" | `.photo-wrap { border-radius: 50% → 4px }` |
| "Swap the photo" | edit `data/designs.json` `primary_photo` |
| "Arched frame" | `border-radius: 50% 50% 4px 4px` |
| "I don't like this layout" | re-read `design-principles.md`; rewrite the template (don't try to patch a bad layout) |

For visual choices ("square / round / oval photo frame?"), build all three and use Tier 1 (HTML preview).

Average iterations: 3-5 rounds.

## Stage 6 — Render + open gallery

When the user is satisfied (single mode) or after all variants are designed (multi mode):

1. **Render PNGs + build gallery** in one shot:
   ```bash
   npm run render && npm run gallery
   ```

   - `render.js` shells out to Chrome / Chromium / Edge and outputs **two sizes per design**:
     - `dist/png/social/<id>.png` — 1080×1440 (for messaging, email, social)
     - `dist/png/print/<id>.png`  — 2160×2880 at 300 DPI (for physical printing)
   - `build-gallery.js` reads `designs.json` and writes `dist/index.html`:
     - **Single mode** (1 design): the detail page directly — iframe preview + palette/typography meta + two download buttons
     - **Multi mode** (N designs): a grid landing + per-design `dist/<id>-page.html` with prev/next/back

   If Chrome isn't found, `render.js` prints install instructions for the user's OS.

2. **Open the gallery** so the user sees the final result(s):
   - macOS: `open dist/index.html`
   - Linux: `xdg-open dist/index.html`
   - Windows: `start dist/index.html`

3. **The user takes it from there.** They click "Social" or "Print" to download. They can pick where to save (browser's native download UI handles this — no need to ask).

   **In multi mode**, the user can also reply "let me iterate on #3" → drop back into single-mode Stage 5 flow with that variant as the working template, then come back to Stage 6 when refined.

That's the deliverable. PNGs are saved via browser download into the user's chosen location, then sent (messaging app, email, AirDrop, print) — outside the skill's scope.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Reading `examples/*.html`** — design-principles.md is your only visual reference
- ❌ **Defaulting to Chinese** — always ask language first
- ❌ **Speaking English to a user who picked Chinese (or any non-English language)** — switch your conversational language at Stage 2 and stay there
- ❌ **Asking about lunar date when `zh` is NOT in `languages`** — it's a Chinese-specific field; skip it entirely otherwise
- ❌ Asking style choices in plain text ("traditional or modern?") — always show visuals
- ❌ **Picking an aesthetic without looking at the photos** — frame shape / formality must match the photo's framing & pose
- ❌ **Shipping a template with a cropped forehead / chin / half-visible person** — always do the Stage 5 crop review before declaring done
- ❌ **Silently picking 1 photo out of 20** — if the user dropped a folder of photos, discuss which to feature before designing
- ❌ **Elements bleeding outside the 420×height canvas** — vertical text, oversized numerals, SVG decorations, negative-offset absolutes must stay inside; use `overflow:hidden` on `.card` as a safety net
- ❌ Suggesting upload to any cloud / online editor / SaaS
- ❌ Skipping Stage 2.5 — always ask single vs multi explicitly
- ❌ **In multi mode**, generating N similar designs — they must look meaningfully different, not 3 minor variants of the same template
- ❌ **In single mode**, shotgun-generating multiple drafts to "pick from" — converge with iteration, not selection
- ❌ Hardcoding any user data in a template (always `{{path}}` placeholders)
- ❌ Continuing past Stage 1 without confirmed photos on disk
- ❌ Using bash-only commands when the user is on Windows
